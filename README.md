# Forecast

#### This is a simple app I built for a workshop I lead on developing with the Vue javascript framework. It collects 5 days of weather data for a predefined location and presents it to the user in a simple format.

## Tech used
- Vue JS
- Vuetify
- Axios
- Apexcharts
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Building and running project
An OpenWeatherMap API key is required to run the project (the calls made are covered under their free tier)

Get an API key here https://openweathermap.org/api

Paste your API key into the `.env.development` file so that it can be accessed by the app, then run the following

```
npm install
npm run serve
```
